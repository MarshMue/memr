#Facebook to Telegram Subscription Service
  * A telegram bot that sends facebook page posts directly to your telegram account!
  * Be able to keep up to date with your latest interests without having to get on the distraction that is Facebook!

##How to use
 * Create your own bot and use this code or modify it to whatever you like
 * add @memr_bot on telegram and use my version (note: not always running as it is being tested and is searching for a permanent home to run from)

##Features
 * Image posts and gallery posts
 * Saves user subscriptions if bot stops running, and command or new posts made while offline will be sent when bot returns to function

##TODO
 * Implement support for videos, regular posts and others
